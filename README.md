`Mix` is a statically typed programming language, with interesting features from C, C++, Rust, Lua and Java. That's why it was named `Mix`. It's goal is to become an extensible and embeddable scripting language, and also a general purpose programming language if possible.

### TODO list

* codegen(working on branch `codegen`)
* hex/oct number format support
* documentation and tutorial
* emacs/vim syntax support
* variadic generics grammar
* llvm support
